Python Examples
===============

Introduction
------------

When I was learning Python I had to go all over the web to find the examples I needed. I decided to put some common examples here to make it easier for others who are learning Python to find. If these scripts are helpful or if you have suggestions for other examples that should be added, please let me know. Please note all of my scripts are compatible with the 2.x version of Python and may need to be modified to work in the 3.x version of Python. There are significant differences in the two versions of Python. If you need help choosing which version to use see [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3](http://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3). I use the 2.x version of Python because it is the default version in Ubuntu and BT5.
